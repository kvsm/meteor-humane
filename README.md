DEPRECATED - been a long time since Meteor used smart packages :smile_cat:
Have a look at the official npm package: (https://www.npmjs.com/package/humane-js)

meteor-humane
======

This is a Meteor smart package wrapper for the [humane.js](http://wavded.github.io/humane-js/) notification library, written by Marc Harter.

Check the [humane.js page](http://wavded.github.io/humane-js/) for demo and usage.
